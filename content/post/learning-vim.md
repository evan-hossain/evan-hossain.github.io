Like a lot of people, Vim has always been a mystery to me. I never really tried to understand or give it a shot until very recently. But why now?
## Motivation
I was looking at split keyboards for a more ergonomic setup. Besides the hectic price tags, split keyboards seem to have a rather stiff learning curve. During that research only, I stumbled upon the idea that using vim has its own ergonomic benefits since it greatly reduces hand movements. And it supposedly can make me more productive! So here I am, giving it a solid try.

## How I started
I just googled "learning vim" or something similar and decided to start with [this](https://github.com/iggredible/Learn-Vim) github project since it had more than 9k stars. I started this portfolio site building project around the same time. So I decided to work on this project solely using Vim and I have done so till now. But I felt it was not enough to just work on this project to be confident enough in Vim to use it as my main editing tool. I needed another way to practice it more on more diverse tasks. That's when I found the idea.
## How I continued
We have had quite a few holidays in December in Ireland. Besides playing with Vim, I was also trying to get comfortable using Kotlin, especially the higher order functions. Since I love solving algorithmic problems anyway, I figured it'd be best if solved those problems in Kotlin using Vim. Of course I'm working at a much slower pace than usual with two new tools but that's not the goal here. After practicing for few hours in the last couple of weeks, I feel comfortable with the basic Vim motions. Although I can't say I perform those intuitively yet but I'm getting there. Another thing to note here is that I can type ~70-80 WPM if it's alphabets only. I suffer with numbers and punctuation. So those are somewhat hindering the learning as well. Looking back, the original goal of reducing hand movements definitely seems like a possibility. 
## Tools 
For this portfolio project, I use iTerm only and edit the text in the terminal. But for the algorithmic problems, I'm using Intellij community edition with Kotlin and IdeaVim plugins.
## What's next
I'll continue practicing Vim at home for a few more weeks before fully switching to it for my daily job. In the meantime, I plan to upload the Kotlin codes I write in the [Kotlin]({{< ref "/kotlin" >}}) posts. This shall allow me to keep practicing and also remain motivated to keep the portfolio updated.
