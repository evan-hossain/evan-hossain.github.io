I was looking to try something new during the December holidays in 2022. 
This site is the result. As the first post in the new year, reflecting on 
the past year is probably a good start.

2022 has gone great for me. I decided to take a break in between jobs in late 2021 and spend
some time with my family at home. As a result, I was able to spend the first few months at home with my loved ones.
Attended gatherings, parties, weddings, went on family tours, and of course just stayed at home. 

In the meantime, I was also working on the paperwork, work pass and visa related things for moving to Dublin, Ireland.
This part wasn't easy. Due to long queues from the Covid restricted times, every step took significantly longer than usual.
 
Finally, arrived at Dublin on 5th April and started at Google on 11th. The offices were opening around the same time after Covid, so both Nooglers and Googlers who joined during the pandemic were exploring the offices together for the first time. Few of my friends were already working here at Google and other companies. It was nice to reunite with them, and made some new friends as well!

Dublin is much colder compared to the tropical weather I'm used to. When I arrived in April, summer was just around the corner. It was still windy and somewhat chilly, so I still needed windbreakers and light jackets to move around. Few months went by, it was almost winter here and time to go home! Lot of other things happened in the new city, I wish to write about those in separate posts. Keeping it short for now.

I had another couple of incredible months at home. Visited my village with everyone after many years, crossing Padma bridge on the way. It was nice to show my wife around the schools, the places I spent a few years at. Now she has a better understanding of why I compare most of the tourist spots to some random places from that village. 

I came back to Dublin early December and started experiencing "the real Irish weather". It was really cold but not unbearable in any way. It also snowed for a few days. Around this time Dublin got into the holiday mode, hence this site and the blog.

That's it for now, wish to continue writing about small things. Happy new year!
